## General Information
On an NxN chessboard, the queens are at random points and try to place them in such places that no queen is threatened. For more information, check 
For more information, check out https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-queen-problem-backtracking-3/.
In our approach, we have 
1. Local search 
2. Constraint satisfaction

We use Grid.Java to represent queens in a board ( __NxN__ grid, queen as binary values)
Grid is randomly initialized with queens in any columns.
