## General Information
On an NxN chessboard, the queens are at random points and try to place them in such places that no queen is threatened. 
In our approach, we use two different(#1 Local search algorithm, #2 Online search algorithm)

We use Grid.Java file to represent queens in a board (consider table as a nxn grid where binary values represent existance of queen)
